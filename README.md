# msfs_mouse_yoke

This is a small script written in Python for letting you fly with your mouse in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020. (Why is this not implemented in the game yet?)

## Installation

To run the script, just open the file run.bat. You must have Python installed in your computer.\
If you want to modify the key for turning the script on/off, you have a file called config.json.

```javascript
// config.json

{
  "master_key": ","
}

```

You can also use hotkeys, i.e. "shift+s"

#### Aside note: I made this script for a friend of mine in a few minutes, so it's not perfect by any means. It'll probably have some bugs and its not that usable because you don't have a way to control the throttle. I will add that feature soon. 

Enjoy!
